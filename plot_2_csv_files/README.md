1- First I run the
```
python cascaded_or_linear_with_tensorboard.py
```
twice 
run the first time with linear  and the second time with cascaded 
and don't forgt to change the name of the folder in the summary writer 

2- in the terminal run this: 
tensorboard --logdir=runs/cascaded 
then go to download data as csv 
do the same thing by running 
tensorboard --logdir=runs/cascaded 
then go to download data as csv  
now you have two csv files

3. run python plot_graphs.py
